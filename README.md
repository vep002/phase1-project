# Rotten Cabbages - a simple movie review app

This app displays movies saved in a JSON server database. Users can search movies by genre and delete a movie if they want. Users can also use a form on the site to add a movie, which will appear on the frontend, including the movie's poster and trailer. All changes are persisted to the backend.

Live demo coming soon

## How to run locally:

- git clone this repository
- cd into the backend folder, then cd into "phase-1-json-server-project-guidelines"
- run npm install
- run npm start to start the JSON server
- cd into the frontend folder
- run `open index.html`
