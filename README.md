# Rotten Cabbages - a simple movie review app

This app displays movies saved in a JSON server database. Users can search movies by genre and delete a movie if they want. Users can also use a form on the site to add a movie, which will appear on the frontend, including the movie's poster and trailer. All changes are persisted to the backend.
